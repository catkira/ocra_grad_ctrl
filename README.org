#+TITLE: OCRA gradient DAC controller core

Rev 1.0

Benjamin Menkuec, Vlad Negnevitsky

* Summary

  Unified core that contains

  - four gradient BRAMs and a BRAM-reading FSM module that produces groups of four 24-bit words

  - OCRA1-compatible SPI serialiser module that forwards this data to the AD5781 DACs on the OCRA1 gradient board

  - GPA-FHDO-compatible SPI serialiser module that forwards this data to the four-channel AC80504 DAC on the GPA-FHDO gradient board

  - Behavioural models of the DACs and generic testbenches for each module, designed to be run with Icarus Verilog/GTKWave.

* Simulating the designs in Icarus Verilog
